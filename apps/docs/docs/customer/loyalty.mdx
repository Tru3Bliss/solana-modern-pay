# Loyalty Program

If your merchant has enabled loyalty programs for their shop, you will be have access to various benefits.

## Points back

Your merchant could have enabled points back, where you can earn points on every purchase. Once you have enough points, you will have the option to checkout with the points instead of paying with USDC.

## Tiered discounts

With tiers, once you have spent a certain amount of money, your wallet will automatically be given a discount for all future orders. The amount of money and discount is set by the merchant, and will appear on your checkout screen.

## Unique NFTs

Your merchant could have enabled unique NFTs for their shop. If so, you will receive an NFT that represent the products you have purchased. You can view your NFTs in the wallet button of the checkout screen, and your merchant may choose to enable special benefits for holders of certain NFTs.
