## About

Solana pay is currently setup with Shopify, and allows integration with your Shopify store. It allows merchants to accept crypto (USDC for now), and offer loyalty programs to their customers.

For the customer, the process is straightforward. At checkout, they would select Solana Pay, connect their Solana wallet, and approve the transaction. This process is designed to be fast, secure, and user-friendly.

Security is a top priority for Solana Pay. We do not store personal data about customers beyond their onchain activity (wallet addresses and USDC spent).

If you need assistance or have any questions, please reach out to us at product@solana.com. You can also visit our [support page](https://merchant.solanapay.com/support) for more information.
